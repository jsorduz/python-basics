# python-basics
This is a basic python repository with information/notes about the language

## Topics
- Closures
- Coroutines

## Usage
This repository uses jupyter notebook to illustrate the theory  with examples.
The jupyter notebooks are divided into topics and they are in the notebooks folder.
You can use your local jupyter configuration or use docker-compose to use a generic configuration running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then, you will obtain in the terminal a link that redirects you to your web browser where jupyter runs.
