    "# AsyncIO\n",
    "AsyncIO is a concurrent programming design which sometimes we associate with concepts as *concurrency, parallelism, threading, multiprocessing, etc*. Then let's start with some definitions:\n",
    "- parallelism: perform multiple operations at the same time.\n",
    "- multiprocessing: is a way to perform parallelism where tasks are spread over CPUs or cores\n",
    "- concurrency: perform multiple tasks in an overlapped manner. It is a bigger concept thatn parallelism and concurrency does not imply parallelism\n",
    "- threading: concurrent execution model where multiples threads takes turns executing tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the above concepts, **asyncIO is a library to write concurrent code, but is not threading or multiprocessing**.\n",
    "It is a single-threaded, single-process design that uses **cooperative multitasking**.\n",
    "The difference between AsyncIO and threading is that:\n",
    "- threading: operative system controls the change between threads, then the code doesn't need to do anything to make them switch but it can be difficult because it can change anytime.\n",
    "- AsyncIO: programmer constrols the change between tasks, then it is expected cooperative multitasking: the tasks must announce when they are ready to be switched out. This implies extra work but we know exactly where the task will be swapped out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency and therefore AsyncIO is useful when our program must wait for external sources, for example, http requests, upload/download files, printer, etc. Then, instead of waste time waiting for the external source, we pause the current task and advance with another one, then we go back to the first task to see if the external source is ready or we continue with something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summaryzing, AsyncIO uses one thread and one core, and instead of waiting for external entities, it does something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For basic usage we will be using:\n",
    "- **async** is used to define a native coroutine or an asynchronous generator: async def, async with or async for.\n",
    "- **await** passes the control back to the event loop while waiting for a result."
